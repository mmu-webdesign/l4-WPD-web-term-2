# RWD - Week One

## Developing content for your portfolio

During the Spring Term you will be developing a 'responsive' portfolio web site for the assignment. The content for this site will be developed and assessed under the Digital Asset Creation unit. 
The quality of any website is reflective on the owner. You are not only being judged on your coding, design, accessibility and usability (Web Page Development) but also on the quality of the text and media (Digital Asset Creation).

[Heidi Cohen](https://twitter.com/heidicohen) describes content as:

>“High quality, useful information that conveys a story presented in a contextually relevant manner with the goal of soliciting an emotion or engagement. Delivered live or asynchronously, content can be expressed using a variety of formats including text, images, video, audio, and/or presentations.”

Well written content and high quality media is essential for the success of your portfolio.

In the 2 Digital Asset Creation assessments you have / will have created the following content:

* a Production Summary Report 
* a 4.5 minute audio documentary
* a written narrative
* 6 photographic images

For the Web Page Development assessment you will be using your DAC content as follows:

### Introduction
* a written narrative (500 words +/- 10%) 

### Audio
* a 4.5 minute audio documentary

### Photography gallery
* 6 photographic images (from Assessment)
* 6 captions (using your text for each image from Assessment)

You may want to include links to your social media feeds if you have them.


## Images for the gallery

- Using the six images from the first DAC assignment.
- If they can all be the same orientation (landscape or portrait) it does make things simpler, but is not essential. 
- The images can later be sized appropriately and optimized for the web when you know more about the layout you are creating.
- **You will require a 7th original image for your 'big banner', often known as the 'hero' image**. This is going to be used at a much larger size. It needs to be high quality. It should be landscape. You may chose to use a short video instead.
- Remember to keep the full size original images - always edit copies.

## Task 1 - Mood board

To kick off the design process create a mood board to collate influences and ideas for the portfolio page you are about to create. This will include:

* Colours 
* Typography

Use your 6 photographs as the starting point. Sample some of the colours, looking for a theme. Also start to think about a 'hero' image. Do you already have a suitable image? Do you need to create one?

The influences may be digital or physical.

>&ldquo;Mood boards are visually stunning collections of ideas, full of textures and images that communicate the vision of a designer at the start of a project.&rdquo;

Read the article [20 pro tips for creating inspirational mood boards](https://www.creativebloq.com/graphic-design/mood-boards-812470) before starting.

### Inspiration

Here's [a massive list of portfolio sites for inspiration](https://github.com/wilsonderren/website-inspiration). These sites will be more complex than what we are asking you to create but you can look for inspiration in colour, typography and writing styles and content.

### Creating your Mood board

You can create your mood board any way that suits, PhotoShop, PowerPoint or even a physical item.

## Task 2 - Optimise your images

Your 6 images need to be optimised for the web. At this stage you may be unsure of the final size required for your images. To get things started follow these instructions. You can repeat to the size you need later if needed.

* Make copies of your six images
* Put the six originals in a safe location
* Make all six copies 800px wide
* Run each image through the *Save for the web* process in PhotoShop

**Remember**, *you are looking for a balance between quality and file size. Save as, when you have reached that balance*. 

For further optimisation you can also [run files through Tiny jpg online](https://tinyjpg.com/).

We'd expect these images to be below 40kb if possible but don't wreck them. Talk to tutors if your images need to be more.

You now have 6 images ready for the image gallery that you are creating over the coming weeks.

## Task 3 - Hero image

You need to either identify one of your original images for the *hero* image or create a new one.

If you have a relevant image (you can always change it later as the project develops), follow these steps:

* You will require an image that is 3000 pixels or wider. If smaller, you will end up stretching and distorting the image.

* Create a copy of your orginal - always work on a copy.

* Resize your image to 3000 pixels wide (this ensures high quality on the best screen). The height should remain relative.

* Optimize your image for the web. At these dimensions it may still be hundreds of kbs. If it is 1mb or more it is probably too big and can be further optimised.

## Coming weeks

Over the coming weeks you are going to develop your portfolio site to showcase your text and media from Digital Asset Creation (DAC).

Your six photographs are now ready, and you may have selected a hero image. This is only the start, you will be free to make adjustments over the coming weeks.

**Note**: the images have already been assessed in Assignment One of DAC. In Assignment Two of Web Page Development we will be marking the image implementation (including optimisation), not the images themselves. They are not part of the DAC Assignment Two marking either.
